# 🚀 Getting Started with Angular

Welcome! This guide will help you install Angular CLI and create your first Angular app step-by-step using simple commands. Let's build something awesome!

---

## ✅ Step 1: Install Angular CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This installs the Angular CLI globally so you can use it from anywhere on your system.

You're installing the Angular CLI globally on your system. That means you can now use `ng` commands like `ng new`, `ng serve`, etc., from anywhere in your terminal — for any project.

#### 💡 What to do in future projects:
Once you’ve done the global install once, for any new Angular project you just need to do:

```bash
ng new my-next-project
cd my-next-project
ng serve
```
**No need to repeat `-g`.**

#### 🔁 When to reinstall with `-g`:
Only reinstall globally if:
- You switch to another computer or OS
- Your global CLI gets corrupted
- You want to upgrade the Angular CLI globally (use `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`)

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create a New Angular App

Run the following command:

```bash
ng new my-app
```

You'll be asked a few setup questions (like whether to use routing or choose CSS/SCSS). Choose based on your preference.

The CLI will:
- Create a new folder named `my-app`
- Set up your Angular workspace
- Install all required dependencies

---

## ✅ Step 3: Move into Your Project

Navigate into your new app directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Run the App

Start the development server with:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

This will:
- Compile and build your app
- Automatically open it in your default browser
- Run it at: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

# 📁 Understanding Angular Project Structure

## 📦 `package.json`

This file is the *brain* of your Angular project. It keeps track of:
- Project name and version
- Tools and libraries used
- Scripts/commands for running your app

## 📄 `tsconfig.json`

This is the TypeScript config file. It tells TypeScript:
- What files to include/exclude
- What version of JavaScript to compile into
- Whether to enforce strict types
- Where to store compiled files

### 🧠 Why it's important:
TypeScript is strict—it needs rules. This file provides those rules.

## 📄 `tsconfig.app.json`

This file tells TypeScript how to handle the **main app** code:
- What files to look at 👀
- What kind of JavaScript to convert to ⚙️
- Where to find things 🧭

## 🧪 `tsconfig.spec.json`

Used for **testing**. It guides how TypeScript should handle your test files and environment.

## ⚙️ `angular.json`

This is the **master config file** for your Angular project. It tells Angular:
- How to build and serve your app
- Where your files live
- Which styles/scripts to include
- How to run tests and manage environments

### 🧠 Why it matters:
This is where Angular gets all its instructions on how your project is structured and how to work with it.

## 📄 `package-lock.json`

This file is automatically generated when dependencies are installed.

It:
- Locks the exact versions of packages
- Ensures consistency for every developer
- Speeds up future installations

## 🎉 You're Ready!

That’s it! You’ve created your first Angular app and learned what each important file does. Keep building and exploring 🚀

# How To use loops in Angular
## create a file name `app.component.html` add this code inside it:
```
@for(user of users; track user; let id=$index){
  <div class="user-info">{{id}}</div>
  <div>{{ user.name }}</div>
  <div>{{ user.age }}</div>
  @for(role of user.roles; track role){
    <div>{{ role }}</div>
  }
}
```
## create a file name `app.component.ts` add this code inside it:
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-toggle-elements',
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: './toggle-elements.component.html',
  styleUrl: './toggle-elements.component.css',
})
export class ToggleElementsComponent {
  
  users = [
    {
      name: 'Alice',
      age: 30,
       roles: ['Engineer','Designer'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Bob',
      age: 25,
       roles: ['Designer'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Charlie',
      age: 28,
       roles: ['Developer'],
    },
  ];
}

# All About Signals
### What is signal 
 `A signal is a wrapper around a value 
  That give a signal when value changes
  ```
count = signal(10)
normal method
count = 10 
```
 `
