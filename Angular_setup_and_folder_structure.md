# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Angular

This guide will help you install Angular CLI and create your first Angular app step-by-step using simple commands.

---

## âœ… Step 1: Install Angular CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:

```bash
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g @angular/cli
This installs the Angular CLI globally so you can use it from anywhere.

âœ… Step 2: Create a New Angular App
Now letâ€™s create your first app. Run this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ng new my-app
Youâ€™ll be asked a few questions (like whether to use routing or CSS/SCSS). Just choose what fits your project.

The CLI will:

Create a new folder called my-app

Set up your Angular workspace

Install all the required files and packages

âœ… Step 3: Move into Your Project
After it's done, go into your new project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd my-app
âœ… Step 4: Run the App
Now, start the Angular development server with this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ng serve --open
This will:

Build your app

Open it automatically in your default browser

Run it at: http://localhost:4200
