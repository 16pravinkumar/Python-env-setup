# 🚀 Getting Started with Angular

Welcome! This guide will help you install Angular CLI and create your first Angular app step-by-step using simple commands. Let's build something awesome!

---

## ✅ Step 1: Install Angular CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This installs the Angular CLI globally so you can use it from anywhere on your system.

You're installing the Angular CLI globally on your system. That means you can now use `ng` commands like `ng new`, `ng serve`, etc., from anywhere in your terminal — for any project.

#### 💡 What to do in future projects:
Once you’ve done the global install once, for any new Angular project you just need to do:

```bash
ng new my-next-project
cd my-next-project
ng serve
```
**No need to repeat `-g`.**

#### 🔁 When to reinstall with `-g`:
Only reinstall globally if:
- You switch to another computer or OS
- Your global CLI gets corrupted
- You want to upgrade the Angular CLI globally (use `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`)

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create a New Angular App

Run the following command:

```bash
ng new my-app
```

You'll be asked a few setup questions (like whether to use routing or choose CSS/SCSS). Choose based on your preference.

The CLI will:
- Create a new folder named `my-app`
- Set up your Angular workspace
- Install all required dependencies

---

## ✅ Step 3: Move into Your Project

Navigate into your new app directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Run the App

Start the development server with:

```bash
ng serve --open
```

This will:
- Compile and build your app
- Automatically open it in your default browser
- Run it at: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

# 📁 Understanding Angular Project Structure

## 📦 `package.json`

This file is the *brain* of your Angular project. It keeps track of:
- Project name and version
- Tools and libraries used
- Scripts/commands for running your app

## 📄 `tsconfig.json`

This is the TypeScript config file. It tells TypeScript:
- What files to include/exclude
- What version of JavaScript to compile into
- Whether to enforce strict types
- Where to store compiled files

### 🧠 Why it's important:
TypeScript is strict—it needs rules. This file provides those rules.

## 📄 `tsconfig.app.json`

This file tells TypeScript how to handle the **main app** code:
- What files to look at 👀
- What kind of JavaScript to convert to ⚙️
- Where to find things 🧭

## 🧪 `tsconfig.spec.json`

Used for **testing**. It guides how TypeScript should handle your test files and environment.

## ⚙️ `angular.json`

This is the **master config file** for your Angular project. It tells Angular:
- How to build and serve your app
- Where your files live
- Which styles/scripts to include
- How to run tests and manage environments

### 🧠 Why it matters:
This is where Angular gets all its instructions on how your project is structured and how to work with it.

## 📄 `package-lock.json`

This file is automatically generated when dependencies are installed.

It:
- Locks the exact versions of packages
- Ensures consistency for every developer
- Speeds up future installations

## 🎉 You're Ready!

That’s it! You’ve created your first Angular app and learned what each important file does. Keep building and exploring 🚀

# How To use loops in Angular
## create a file name `app.component.html` add this code inside it:
```
@for(user of users; track user; let id=$index){
  <div class="user-info">{{id}}</div>
  <div>{{ user.name }}</div>
  <div>{{ user.age }}</div>
  @for(role of user.roles; track role){
    <div>{{ role }}</div>
  }
}
```
## create a file name `app.component.ts` add this code inside it:
```
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-toggle-elements',
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: './toggle-elements.component.html',
  styleUrl: './toggle-elements.component.css',
})
export class ToggleElementsComponent {
  
  users = [
    {
      name: 'Alice',
      age: 30,
       roles: ['Engineer','Designer'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Bob',
      age: 25,
       roles: ['Designer'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Charlie',
      age: 28,
       roles: ['Developer'],
    },
  ];
}

```

# All About Signals
### What is signal 
 A signal is a wrapper around a value 
  That give a signal when value changes
  ```
Signal Method
count = signal(10)

normal method
count = 10 
```

# When to use constructor 
```bash
Think of the constructor in Angular like setting up the stage for a play. It's where you prepare everything that the actor (the component) needs before the play starts. But, the constructor is not where the actual acting (like making API calls or showing data) happens.

Here’s an analogy to make it clearer:

Imagine you're preparing for a play:
The constructor is like getting ready backstage. You set up everything you need: the costumes, the script, the props, etc. But you're not acting yet — you're just getting everything ready.

Once everything is ready backstage, you step on the stage and start the show. In Angular, this is where ngOnInit() comes in. It’s like saying, "Now, the show has started, let’s do the acting!" This is when the actual API calls and other tasks happen.

Why not call APIs in the constructor?
The constructor is too early: The stage isn’t ready yet, and the show hasn’t started. If you try to do something big like calling an API or showing something on the screen, it might not work properly because Angular hasn’t finished setting up the component yet.

Better control: Using ngOnInit() is like saying, "Now the stage is set, let's start the real action."

Simple Explanation:
Constructor = Set up things (like getting costumes ready, but not acting yet).

ngOnInit() = Start the show (where you actually perform, like calling APIs and displaying data).

So, in short: Constructor is for preparing things, and ngOnInit() is for starting the action (like calling APIs, showing data, etc.).

 # Directives in angular
 ```
Directive is a class that adds additional behavior to elements in your application
A feature in angular that help you to provide more power to DOM elements
eg
If-else condition
For loop
Add style
ngIf, ngFor, ngStyle, ngSwitch, ngClass
```
